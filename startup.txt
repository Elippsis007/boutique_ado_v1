-- Installing Django (**Needs to be done on each launch)
1. pip3 install Django==3.2


-- Creating project in the current directory (** NOT Necessary for launching project again.)
2. django-admin startproject boutique_ado .


-- Create gitignore file (**Not necessary for launching project again.)
3. touch .gitignore


-- Run server
4. python3 manage.py runserver


-- Migrations
5. python3 manage.py migrate


-- Create a superuser so I can login into admin console.
6. python3 manage.py createsuperuser (** Necessary for launching project again.)
    admin / Cristina007


-- Installing Allauth
7. pip3 install django-allauth==0.41.0 (** Necessary for launching project again.)
    
    7.2 ** Be sure to get the Allauth "AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS" to add to our "settings.py" file.

        AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [

    # Needed to login by username in Django admin, regardless of `allauth`
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',

    # `allauth` specific authentication methods, such as login by e-mail
    'allauth.account.auth_backends.AuthenticationBackend',
]

    7.3 ** Be sure to get the "installed apps" from the document and add to "settings.py" file

    'django.contrib.sites',
    'allauth',
    'allauth.account',
    'allauth.socialaccount',


-- Add SITE_ID = 1 to the settings.py
8. Add SITE_ID = 1 under AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS


-- Adding allauth URLS to our project "urls.py" file.
    * Creating a path called accounts/ and it's used to include all of the allauth.urls
9. Create a "path" => path('accounts/', include('allauth.urls')), 


-- Adding "include to "urls.py" file 
10. In "urls.py" on the line => from django.urls import path, "include" needs to be added 
    Gives me all the urls I need for the login, logout, password resets etc.


-- Run the server and navigate to /admin url to login
11. Login to the admin console


-- Change sites domain
12. Navigate to sites and give name of site eg. boutique_ado.example.com
    Change your display name to eg. Boutique Ado
    ** This is a critical setting if I am using social media authentication
        This isn't something I am doing now but no harm in doing it in the case that we would
        use social media authentication in the future.


-- Adding EMAIL_BACKEND to "settings.py" file
13.  By default allauth will send confirmation emails to ANY NEW accounts
     Those emails have to be temporarily logged to the console so we can get the confirmation links

     EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend' => Add this under SITE_ID in "settings.py"


-- Additional settings for the "settings.py" file

14. ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD = 'username_email' --> Tells allauth that we want to allow authentication using either usernames/emails
    ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED = True --> Tells that email is required for registering for the site
    ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION = 'mandatory' --> Mandatory for an email address
    ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_EMAIL_ENTER_TWICE = True --> Will be required for the user to enter their email twice upon registration to eliminate typos
    ACCOUNT_USERNAME_MIN_LENGTH = 4 --> Specifies username characther length
    LOGIN_URL = '/accounts/login/' --> Specifying a login url
    LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/success' --> Specifying a url to redirect back to after user logging in.  


-- Would be a good idea to "freeze-requirements"
15. pip3 freeze > requirements.txt


-- Create templates directory for me to write some frontend code
16. mkdir templates

-- Create allauth template to hold the customized allauth templates
17. mkdir templates/allauth


-- Making a copy of the "allauth" templates for customizaton
18. cp -r ../.pip-modules/lib/python3.8/site-packages/allauth/templates/* ./templates/allauth/
    * Will create a list of files inside "templates/allauth"
    

-- Creating a base.html
19. Right click on the templates directory folder and create new file for our base.html file
    Here we should go to Bootstrap to get a boilerplate template for the website.
    ** import jQuery 


   <!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Required meta tags -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">

-- Add compatiability support for Edge - To elimiate validation errors when validation HTML
20. <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    Add this line of code above UTF-8


-- Move the JScript src under above the title so that it loads faster
21.


-- Add "load static" to the top of the page above our doc string
22. Add {% load static %} 
    * Advisable now to commit changes


NOTE -- The base template will now act as a framework for our entire project
        Advisable to organize the base template into blocks so that when it's extended
        later on I can replace chunks of the blocsk when I need to.

        Wrap the "meta" content in a {% block %} --> {% endblock %}
        Wrap the "bootstrap css" content in a {% block corecss %} --> {% endblock %}
        Wrap the "JavaScript" content in a {% block jscore %} --> {% endblock %}

        ** In the case that I want to add any extra "meta", "js", "css" without
            causing issues to the core requirements, add 3 "EXTRA" blocks

        {% block extra_meta %}
        {% endblock %}

        {% block extra_css %}
        {% endblock %}

        {% block extra_js %}
        {% endblock %}

        <title>Boutique Ado {% block extra_title %}{% endblock %} </title>
        * This is ideal for when you wish to say Boutique Ado - Products or Contact etc..


--  Django messages device
23. Create a div with class called "message-container" and wrap around {% if messages %} {% endif %}


-- Add a block page header which will act as an additional header on pages that use this template
    and in the case that I want to put something at the top of those pages but underneatht the main header
    
24. {% block page_header %}
    {% endblock %}


-- A place for my main page content itself to go
25. Add a block content {% block content %} 
    {% endblock %}

-- A place for the JavaScript that I want to load at the end of the body
26. {% block postload.js %} 
    {% endblock %}


-- Creating a "Home App"
27. Here we can use the "base.html" template to get the "Home page" up and running
    
    ** To do this type: python3 manage.py startapp home 
    Press Enter
    I need a "templates directory INSIDE the home file:
    Type: mkdir -p home/templates/home
    
    Once created, right click the inner home directory and create a NEW file called: index.html 


-- Using the "base template" inside my "index.html" page
28. Extend "base.html" inside my index.html page.

    * {% extends "base.html" %}
    * {% load static %}

    Then add a content block with some content in it.
    * {% block content %}
        ** To know if this is working, add a h1 element with a message
      {% endblock %}
    
    
-- I have create a view to view this template, so I go to "views.py"
29. Define an "index" view:
    def index(request):
        """ A view to return the index page """
        return render(request, 'home/index.html')


-- Next copy the project-level urls.py
30. Create a new file in the "home app" and call it "urls.py"
    Paste the content inside the "urls.py"
    A. Remove the doc strings 
    B. Remove "include"
    C. Remove all "paths" and add a path that will render views.index with name of home
        ** path('', views.index, name='home')

    On the same page, it's necessary to "import views" at the top of the page:
        from . import views

    D. Go to the project-level URL and include the home URLS:
        path('', include('home.urls')),

    E. Finally I have to add the "home" app to the "Installed Apps" in "settings.py"
        and connect up my template directories:

        * Add "home" to installed apps -> 'home',
        * Navigate to "TEMPLATES" and INSIDE the "DIRS" squared-Brackets:
            os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates'),
            os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates', 'allauth'),


** Advised run a test: python3 manage.py runserver


-- Create folders
31. Create: mkdir static -- Will hold CSS, JS and other static files
        Create a base.css file INSIDE the static folder
    Create: mkdir media -- Will hold homepage image and eventually all of the product images and for new prod uploaded by store owner
        Upload the homepage image into the media folder
    Create: mkdir static/css


-- Add Google Fonts and FontAwesome
32. Add Google Fonts and FontAwesome to Base.html blocks
        Google Fonts -> BlockCoreCSS
        FontAwesome -> BlockCoreJs


-- Add Settings to link Static and Media files
33. Go to "settings.py"
    ***** This line of code is supposed to be a Tuple *****
    Under STATIC_URL file -> Add: STATICFILES_DIRS = (os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),)

    Adding these MEDIA paths which is where all uploaded media files will go: 
    MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
    MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')


-- Import Settings and Static Function from Django so that Django can SEE my URLS
33. Go to "urls.py"
    from django.conf import settings --> Allows Django to see the MEDIA_URL
    from django.conf.urls.static import static --> Importing static function  

    + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT) --> Allows Django to see the MEDIA_URL

*** Test site now and see how it looks :)


-- Creating another row under <div id="topnav"></div>
34. <div id="topnav" class="row bg-white pt-lg-2 d-none d-lg-flex">
    </div>
    --> Here created new <div></div>

     <div class="row bg-white">
            <!-- Here is Bootstrap Navbar -->
                                                *** See the attribute 100% ***
            <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light w-100">
                <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#main-nav" aria-controls="main-nav" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
                    <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
                </button>
            </nav>
        </div>


-- Create a folder in "Templates" called "includes"
34. mkdir templates/includes -> A place where I can create small snippets of HTML
                                Then I can include them in the "base template" using Django
    
    Create 2 files in the includes folder/directory:
        main-nav.html
        mobile-top-header.html


-- Added html snippet to -> mobile-top-header.html
35. 


-- Added html snipper to -> main-nav.html
36.


-- After adding html snippets
37. Now I have to "include" them into the "base template"
    *** Place this 
    -> {% include 'includes/mobile-top-header.html' %} --> Mobile version of the Top Header
        {% include 'includes/main-nav.html' %}


-- Run project to see changes
38.


-- Add another row to the header for the banner
40. With a template variable called "free_shipping_threshold"
    --> Added css class to the base.css file


Product App

-- Copy over images to media folder

-- To create Products app: python3 manage.py startapp Products
    *** Don't forget to add to "settings.py":
        Navigate to "settings.py" and then include app 'products',

    Inside the "products" app I need to make a folder called "fixtures"
        "fixtures" are used to load data very quickly into a Django database
        to avoid me having to do it manually in the admin console.
        To do this I can drop .JSON fixture files into the directory of "fixtures"
        Example: "categories.json"
                    "products.json"
        *** These will be used to create all of the products for my store


With the fixture files copied over and the product app created: 
    I need to create some "models" for the fixtures to go in to...
        "models.py"

** Starting with "categories" to give the products a category.
    Create a class called: Category(models.Model): --> See models.py

    Create a string method -> see models.py


41. --> pip3 install pillow in order for me to use the image field


42. Registering the "Product Model" & "Category" in "admin.py"

    from django.contrib import admin
    from .models import Product, Category
    --> Register your models here. <--
    admin.site.register(Product)
    admin.site.register(Category)


*** Necessary for launching ***
43. Using the fixtures with a NEW - python manage.py command
    --> python3 manage.py loaddata categories (start with categories because the products need to know which categories to go into)
    --> python3 manage.py loaddata categories
